# Kavak Trade-Up Engine - Real Data Integration Guide

## 🚀 System Status: FULLY INTEGRATED AND OPERATIONAL ✅

Your Trade-Up Engine has been successfully integrated with real data sources. The system now supports:

- **✅ Redshift Database Integration** - Load inventory data from your data warehouse
- **✅ CSV Customer Data Processing** - Load and transform customer data from CSV files  
- **✅ Intelligent Fallback Mechanism** - Automatically falls back to sample data if real data is unavailable
- **✅ Full Engine Compatibility** - All calculations and algorithms work with real data
- **✅ Web Dashboard & API** - Complete frontend and backend integration

## 📊 Data Source Configuration

### 1. Redshift Inventory Data

**Required Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Redshift credentials:

```bash
REDSHIFT_HOST=your-redshift-cluster.region.redshift.amazonaws.com
REDSHIFT_PORT=5439
REDSHIFT_DB=your_database_name
REDSHIFT_USER=your_username
REDSHIFT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**SQL Query:** The system uses your existing `redshift.sql` query which has been fixed and optimized.

**Data Mapping:**
- `stock_id` → `car_id`
- `car_brand + model + year + version` → `model` (full model name)
- `regular_published_price_financing` OR `promotion_published_price_financing` → `sales_price` (automatically selects best price)
- Additional fields: `region`, `kilometers`, `color`, `has_promotion`, etc.

### 2. Customer CSV Data

**File Location:** Place your `customer_data.csv` in the root directory
The repository also includes sample CSVs in the `data/` folder for quick testing.

**Expected Columns:**
- `CONTRATO` → Contract identifier
- `STOCK ID` → Current vehicle stock ID
- `current_monthly_payment` → Current monthly payment
- `vehicle_equity` → Vehicle equity value
- `saldo insoluto` → Outstanding loan balance
- `current_car_price` → Current vehicle price
- `risk_profile` → Risk profile (A1, A2, B, C1, etc.)

**Auto-Transformations:**
- Risk profiles automatically mapped to indices
- Customer IDs generated sequentially
- Current car models enriched from inventory data
- Data validation and cleaning applied

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Setup (One-time)

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment:**
   ```bash
   cp env_variables.txt .env
   # Edit .env with your actual Redshift credentials
   ```

3. **Prepare Customer Data:**
```bash
# Place your customer_data.csv in the root directory
# Sample CSVs are in `data/` if you want to test without real data
```

### 2. Start the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:
1. 🔍 Try to connect to Redshift and load inventory data
2. 📊 Load and transform customer data from CSV
3. 🔄 Fall back to sample data if needed
4. 🚀 Start the web server on http://localhost:8000

### 3. Access the Dashboard

- **Main Dashboard:** http://localhost:8000
- **Customer Analysis:** http://localhost:8000/customer/{customer_id}
- **Configuration:** http://localhost:8000/config
- **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📈 Test Results

The integration has been fully tested and verified:

✅ **Data Transformation:** Customer and inventory data correctly mapped  
✅ **Engine Compatibility:** All calculations work with real data structure  
✅ **API Endpoints:** Full CRUD operations functional  
✅ **Web Interface:** Dashboard displays real data properly  
✅ **Offer Generation:** Successfully generates offers with real customer profiles  
✅ **Fallback Mechanism:** Gracefully handles connection failures  

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Set up your .env file** with Redshift credentials
2. **Place your customer_data.csv** in the root directory
   - Sample files are available under `data/` for quick testing
3. **Test with real data** by starting the application

### Production Considerations:
1. **Security:** Ensure .env file is in .gitignore
2. **Performance:** Consider data caching for large datasets
3. **Monitoring:** Set up logging for production use
4. **Backup:** Implement data backup strategies

## 🔍 Data Quality & Validation

The system includes built-in data validation:

- **Customer Data:** Validates payment amounts, equity values, risk profiles
- **Inventory Data:** Validates prices, removes invalid records
- **Risk Profiles:** Maps unknown profiles to safe defaults
- **Missing Data:** Intelligent handling of null/missing values

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Redshift Connection Failed**
   - Check your .env file configuration
   - Verify network access to Redshift cluster
   - Confirm credentials are correct

2. **Customer CSV Not Loading**
   - Ensure file is named `customer_data.csv`
   - Check column names match expected format
   - Verify file is in root directory

3. **No Offers Generated**
   - Check customer risk profiles are valid
   - Verify inventory has cars with higher prices
   - Review engine configuration settings

### Fallback Behavior:
If real data loading fails, the system automatically uses sample data so you can still test and develop. Check the console logs for specific error messages.

## 📞 Support
