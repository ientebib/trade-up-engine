# Frontend API Endpoint Audit

## Summary of Findings

### 1. Missing API Endpoints (Already Disabled)
The frontend code has already been fixed to disable calls to non-existent endpoints:

- **`/api/scenario-summary`** (line 493)
  - Status: ✅ DISABLED - Function returns early (line 490)
  - Used in: Dashboard page to show scenario analysis summary
  
- **`/api/scenario-analysis`** (line 631)
  - Status: ✅ DISABLED - Shows alert and returns early (lines 628-629)
  - Used in: Config page to run full analysis

- **`/api/config-status`** (line 733)
  - Status: ✅ CORRECTLY HANDLED - Falls back to `/api/config` 
  - Comment indicates this is intentional

### 2. Verified Working Endpoints
All other API endpoints called by the frontend exist in the backend:
- ✅ `/api/customers` - Get customer list
- ✅ `/api/generate-offers-basic` - Generate offers for a customer
- ✅ `/api/amortization-table` - Get amortization schedule
- ✅ `/api/save-config` - Save configuration
- ✅ `/api/config` - Get current configuration
- ✅ `/api/health` - Health check (not directly called in main.js)

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ All API calls have proper error handling
- ✅ Errors are caught and displayed to users appropriately
- ✅ 404s and other HTTP errors are handled via `!response.ok` checks

### 4. Response Parsing
- ✅ All responses are parsed as JSON before checking status
- ✅ Error details are extracted from response body correctly
- ✅ Frontend properly handles both success and error response structures

### 5. Potential Issues with || Operator
The code uses `|| 0` pattern which correctly handles undefined/null values but treats 0 as valid:
- Lines 192-193: NPV calculations - `offer.npv || 0` is correct
- Lines 269-282: Offer display values - All use `|| 0` which is appropriate
- Lines 321-325: Amortization table - All use `|| 0` which is appropriate
- Lines 393-394: Breakdown modal - All use `|| 0` which is appropriate

**No issues found** - The `|| 0` pattern is actually correct here since we want to display 0 values.

### 6. Test Data
- ✅ No hardcoded test data found
- ✅ No mock data or dummy values
- ✅ All data comes from API calls

## Recommendations

1. **Consider implementing the missing endpoints** if the features are needed:
   - Scenario analysis could be useful for business analytics
   - Dashboard summary would provide valuable insights

2. **Add API versioning** to prevent future breaking changes:
   - Use `/api/v1/` prefix for all endpoints
   - This allows backward compatibility when updating APIs

3. **Consider adding request/response logging** in development mode:
   ```javascript
   if (window.DEBUG) {
     console.log('API Request:', endpoint, requestData);
     console.log('API Response:', response.status, responseData);
   }
   ```

4. **Add retry logic** for transient failures:
   ```javascript
   async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, retries = 3) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

## Conclusion

The frontend JavaScript code is well-written and properly handles API interactions. The two missing endpoints have already been disabled with appropriate fallbacks. No critical issues were found that would cause runtime errors or data corruption.
